## 7. 🔄 Automation Pipeline Details

This project fully automates every essential step of the data science pipeline. Once a user uploads their data, the following processes run automatically:

### • Automated EDA

- Automatically visualizes and reports key statistics, including data distribution, missing values, outliers, and feature summaries.
- Provides customized diagnostics for classification, regression, and time series tasks.

### • Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Handles missing values, detects and processes outliers, applies scaling and encoding—all with no manual intervention.
- For time series data, automatically creates time-based features (lag, rolling mean, etc.).
- Performs tailored feature engineering for categorical, numerical, and time series data types.

### • Model Search & Leaderboard

- Conducts automated hyperparameter tuning and performance evaluation across multiple algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost, Ridge, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- Provides a leaderboard with the best-performing models and key candidate models for transparent comparison.

### • XAI & Reporting

- Applies Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP and Permutation Importance to visualize prediction results and feature influences.
- Automatically generates a comprehensive HTML report, summarizing the full process, evaluation metrics, and key insights.

- **Scope:**  
  This AutoML platform is optimized for **tabular (structured) data**. It is not designed for image, text (NLP), or raw unstructured data.
- **Large Datasets:**  
  For very large files (over 100,000 rows), certain EDA and model search steps may use sampling or be slower depending on your hardware.
- **Real-Time & Streaming:**  
  The system is intended for **batch/analysis workflows**, not for real-time or streaming inference.
- **Model Coverage:**  
  This platform covers major algorithms for classification, regression, and time series, but does **not** include deep learning or specialized time series architectures (e.g., LSTM, Prophet).
- **Custom Extensions:**  
  If you need more advanced model types or integrations, the codebase is modular for your own extension.
- **Disclaimer:**  
  This software is provided as-is for learning and rapid prototyping; for high-stakes or production deployments, further validation and security reviews are advised.
