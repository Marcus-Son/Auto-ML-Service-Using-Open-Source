## Goal
- Increased accessibility
Due to their complexity, machine learning and artificial intelligence provide entrance obstacles for many consumers. The primary goal of this project is to make these technologies more accessible and to assist both professionals and non-professionals in reaping the benefits of AI and ML.

- Improve the model's interpretability.
The model's 'black box' issue causes a lack of dependability and openness. This project attempts to improve the model's interpretability so that users may better comprehend the model's predictions and conclusions.

- Optimization and Automation
It seeks to automate essential machine learning operations such as data preprocessing, modeling, and optimization in order to help users develop and improve their models more quickly and efficiently.

- Enhanced decision support
To assist companies and individuals in making data-driven decisions by improving data analysis and model interpretation.

## Resolution
- Making Use of AutoML
It uses AutoML technology to automate data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and optimization procedures for users. This enables users to create and optimize machine learning models without the need for sophisticated coding.

- Use of XAI (Explicable AI) Techniques
The XAI technique is used to improve the model's transparency and dependability by visually explaining the model's prediction and variable relevance. Improve the interpretation and dependability of the model by providing users with a detailed grasp of its behavior and prediction.

- Visualization and analysis are detailed.
Provides a multitude of visualizations and analytical features to users in order to deliver meaningful information. Users gain better knowledge of data and model performance as a result.

- It has a user-friendly UI.
Users may simply submit data and review analytic results thanks to user-friendly interfaces. It also facilitates modeling and analysis through simple activities like button clicks.

## Method
- Using Tool: Python, Streamlit
- Data Upload
- Data Preprocessing : Set the target feature and allow the user to select the desired pre-processing format (outlier removal, data scaling, etc.), or use it as the default state.
- EDA: Provides a variety of EDA elements, and provides additional data processing options after EDA
- Modeling & Optimization & Predicting: The AutoML library selects the best performing model among optimized models. Make a prediction with the model.
- Visualization and Results Analysis: Using XAI techniques such as shap,pdp,ice,lime, etc., the importance of variables, the effect of variables on prediction, regional and individual variable analysis, etc. are conducted.

## Results & Expected effects
- Our user-friendly AutoML service utilizes XAI technology to reduce the complexity and increase transparency of artificial intelligence, thereby improving the accessibility of AI technology by helping not only professionals but also nonprofessionals make data-driven decisions easily.
- Our AutoML service simplifies data analysis by providing customized modes for both professionals and nonprofessionals, and integrates XAI technology to clearly understand the validity and results of the model.
- By integrating various libraries such as PyCaret, it is expected to provide users with broader functionality and contribute to the overall industry development.
